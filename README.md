# Firebase Auth with Google and React Context API   

This project will walk you through the steps to set up User Authentiaction via Google sign in using Firebase, React and React Context.  

## What is Firebase?
Firebase is whats known as  a BAAS, or Back End As A Service, for creating mobile and web applications. It was originally an independent company founded in 2011.In 2014, Google acquired the platformand it is now their flagship offering for app development. Its primary features include a Realtime noSQL database, and user authentication.

### What's So Special About it?
Firebase user Authentication is a streamlined, secure way to integrate multiple different sign in methods to our applications including Facebook, Google, Github, Twitter and more.  Additionally, Firebase provides analytics and a database functionality out of the box.  

In short - it's a powerful tool to help set up complex backend tasks in our applicaiton.

### How will this work?
To setup firebase on our apps we will need to perform the following:
* Signup for a Firebase account
* Set up a Create-React-App
* Register an applicaition on Firebase
* Enable Firebase Authentication
* Download our App credientials from Firebase to our `.env`
* Install Firebase via NPM
* Set up our React Context to provide auth data to components
* Set up route guards to allow  ONLY authenticated users acces
* Handle user logout


## Getting started



### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
